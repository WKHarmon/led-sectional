# LED Sectional Enclosure
These are STL files used to 3D print a small enclosure for the [PCB used in this project](https://github.com/WKHarmon/led-sectional/tree/master/pcb%20files). The board is attached to the enclosure using 3 short M2 screws.

I've published this on Seeed Studio's [Fusion Gallery](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LED-Sectional-Board-g-1207811) for easy making.
